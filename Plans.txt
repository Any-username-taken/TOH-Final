////DUNGEON PLAN/GUIDE/ENEMY GUIDE////

The Dungeon has multiple floors, each with their own typing. The deeper you go into the dungeon, the more ferocious
the enemies.

Each floor has different rooms. Rooms - FIGHT/STORY/TREASURE/SHOP/BLESSING/TRAP/SPLIT

FIGHT - 100% to start a fight with a monster.

STORY - learn more about the world by writings on the walls, or npc.
It's up to the player to determine if the npc is trustworthy or not. Some npcs will betray the player, stealing items,
or dealing damage. Others can give you useful items. By paying attention to the way they talk, (and if I'm a good
enough writer), It should be easy for the player to discern who they should trust.

SHOP - Wandering Traders will "randomly" appear throughout the dungeon. Some will scam the player, (they won't know on
the first run though) and others will give you a steal of a deal! \;D EXAMPLE of interaction;

---
